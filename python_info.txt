Python distributions
--------------------

Pyzo: A free distribution based on Anaconda and the IEP interactive development
  environment. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.


IDEs
----
* PyCharm
* WingIDE: zou slechtere UI hebben
* PyDev: Eclipse plugin
* Komodo IDE: zou minder goed zijn dan de rest
* Eric: lijkt niet echt ideaal

To see what packages you have installed:
  pip list
However, make sure you are not using the Strawberry Perl pip!  Check what pip
is in your path!


Installing PIL
--------------
The Python Imaging Library (PIL) cannot be installed with pip 8.0.3, you get the error:

"  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pil (from versions: )
 No matching distribution found for pil"

Note that PIL is no longer maintained:

  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library

Since PIL is basically dead, you should install Pillow, which is a maintained
fork of PIL:

  http://python-pillow.org/

To install, simply use pip:

  pip install pillow



Code coverage
-------------
Coverage.py is a useful tool to measure code coverage:

  http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

We currently use it to measure code coverage of our unit tests.  If the unit
tests are OK, then the HTML coverage report is opened in your browser.  The
logic for this is in the file python/utils/UnittestHelper.py and an example is
in python/acuras/SP_Acuras.py::run_all_tests()
